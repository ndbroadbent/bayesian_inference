Short take: Corey’s article is basically a long, tongue-in-cheek “what if Trump really did tick all the Antichrist boxes?” exercise. A lot of the parallels he draws are striking at the level of vibe and politics, but they depend on ripping verses from their original context and re-aiming them at Trump. Mainstream biblical scholarship does not think Daniel/Revelation were secretly predicting a 21st-century American president.

I’ll split this into 3 parts:

what “Antichrist” actually is in the Bible

what Corey claims, point by point

how convincing that is once you add scholarly context

1. What “Antichrist” and “the Beast” are in the Bible

Biblically, there are three key strands:

“Antichrist” in 1 & 2 John

The only place the word “antichrist” appears is in the Johannine letters, not Revelation.

John says there are many antichrists already, anyone who denies Jesus or deceives the church.
Encyclopedia Britannica
+1

So in strict biblical terms, “antichrist” is more a type than a single future individual.

“Man of lawlessness” (2 Thessalonians 2)

Paul talks about a coming “lawless one” who exalts himself and deceives people with lying signs and wonders.
Encyclopedia Britannica
+1

“The beast” in Revelation 13 & Daniel’s visions

Revelation 13 describes a beast from the sea empowered by the dragon (Satan), worshiped worldwide, persecuting the saints, associated with the number 666.
Encyclopedia Britannica
+1

Daniel 7–11 has beasts, horns and kings, culminating in a blasphemous ruler who oppresses God’s people.

Most critical scholars read these as symbolic of ancient empires (especially Rome in Revelation, and Antiochus IV / Hellenistic kings in Daniel), not literal predictions about modern politicians.
Psephizo
+2
Encyclopedia Britannica
+2

So already there’s a fork:

academic view: “antichrist” is either a symbol for oppressive powers, and/or a class of deceivers, not a detailed roadmap to one US president

popular apocalyptic view: all of these threads glue into a single future villain

Corey is intentionally playing inside that popular framework, then mapping it to Trump.

2. What Corey actually argues about Trump

Corey goes prophecy by prophecy, mainly from Daniel, Revelation, Zechariah, 2 Thessalonians and the Gospels, and lines them up with Trump’s life and presidency.

Here are the main beats he hits:

2.1 Superpower leader, obsessed with winning, boastful and threatening

Military superpower: Daniel’s “fourth kingdom” that can crush the whole earth is taken as a nuclear superpower, which narrows candidates to the US or Russia.
Benjamin L. Corey

Arrogant, boastful speech (Dan 7, Rev 13): he notes Trump’s constant bragging about himself, “great” and “greater” language.
Benjamin L. Corey
+1

“Mouth like a lion” & public threats: prophetic “roaring” is mapped to Trump’s insult-driven, threatening style on Twitter and in rallies.
Benjamin L. Corey

“Bent on conquering” / obsessed with winning: Corey jokes about “winning so much you get tired of winning” as a near-direct echo.
Benjamin L. Corey

2.2 Seven heads / hills and Trump Towers

Revelation’s beast with seven heads/hills is reimagined as seven “tall places of power.”
Benjamin L. Corey

Corey notes Trump has seven prominent properties named “Trump Tower” or equivalent (NYC, Chicago, Istanbul, Toronto, Trump World Tower, Sunny Isles Beach, Manila), and riffs on the photo of them with antennas as “horns.”
Benjamin L. Corey

This is where he leans hard into the “this is probably silly but spooky” humor.

2.3 Political outsider, shock election, minority win, foreign interference

Daniel 11:21’s “despicable person” who is not of royal line but seizes power through intrigue is applied to a political outsider from business with sordid personal history who wins an election no one expects.
Benjamin L. Corey

Daniel 11:23’s “alliance” and “small force” is read as foreign interference and a minority-vote win (popular vote loss, Electoral College win, plus Russian meddling).
Benjamin L. Corey
+1

2.4 Getting rich off office, rewarding loyalists, real-estate deals

Daniel 11:24 “distribute plunder and wealth of the rich” is mapped to Trump using the presidency to enrich his family and allies in novel ways, citing ethics reports accusing him of treating government as a money-making operation.
Benjamin L. Corey

Daniel 11:39 “honor those who acknowledge him… sell them land” becomes Trump rewarding loyalists with high positions and profitable real-estate access.
Benjamin L. Corey

2.5 Changing times and laws, lawlessness, fake news

Dan 7:25 “change set times and laws” is linked to flirting with delaying elections, contesting results, and talk of term extensions.
Benjamin L. Corey

2 Thess 2’s “lawless one” is applied to Trump’s open disregard for norms and frequent clashes with courts.
Benjamin L. Corey
+1

Daniel 8:25 / 2 Thess 2:10 on deceit prospering is tied to “fake news” rhetoric and Trump’s documented pattern of false statements.
Benjamin L. Corey
+1

2.6 Southern border feud and harming the people to the south

Daniel 11’s “king of the North” vs “king of the South” is read as US vs Mexico.
Benjamin L. Corey

Corey maps the whole chapter to Trump’s border wall fight, the April 2019 border visit followed by Pentagon funding, and the escalation afterward.
Benjamin L. Corey

Zechariah 11’s “worthless shepherd” who doesn’t care for the lost, dying or hungry is linked to family separation, kids in cages and poor treatment of migrants.
Benjamin L. Corey
+1

2.7 Evangelical support, “God did this,” and the religious ally

2 Thess 2:9’s deceptive signs and wonders are tied to religious leaders calling Trump’s victory a miracle from God despite his behavior (Corey quotes Franklin Graham saying “Only God could do that”).
Benjamin L. Corey

Rev 13’s “second beast” / “false prophet” who looks lamb-like but speaks like a dragon is mapped to high-profile evangelical leaders (Graham, Jeffress, etc.) selling Trump as God’s man.
Benjamin L. Corey

He points out that white evangelicals were among Trump’s strongest backers in 2016 and 2020.
Pew Research Center

2.8 Pandemic, protests, Lafayette Square, and the “abomination”

Corey then layers on a cluster of 2020 events:

Global pandemic & bitter waters (Rev 8:10-11) interpreted as COVID-19 spreading by droplets, killing many.
Benjamin L. Corey

Zech 11:6 “won’t help the ones who are dying” applied to Trump’s delays, downplaying COVID, and push to reopen.
Benjamin L. Corey

Rev 6:6 “food prices rise, oil spared” mapped to 2020’s food price spikes and negative oil prices.
Benjamin L. Corey

Daniel 11:33’s protests with some falling “by the sword” but little help is mapped onto BLM protests and police violence.
Benjamin L. Corey

Daniel 11:31’s “armed forces… desecrate the temple area” is mapped to the Lafayette Square incident where federal officers cleared protesters with tear gas so Trump could pose with a Bible in front of a church.
Benjamin L. Corey

2.9 Head wound / scandal and survival

Rev 13:3’s “fatal head wound that is healed, the world is amazed” is interpreted metaphorically as a scandal or impeachment that should end his rule but doesn’t.
Benjamin L. Corey

Corey updated in July 2024 after the assassination attempt where Trump was grazed in the ear, explicitly linking the verse to that event in a creepy way.
Benjamin L. Corey

So by the end, his rhetorical conclusion is basically: if conservative evangelicals are serious about watching for a future Antichrist, Trump checks more of their own proof-texts than anyone else they’ve ever seen.

3. How strong is this, once you zoom out?
   3.1 Things Corey is on solid empirical ground about

There are factual pieces that are hard to dispute:

Trump is a nationalist, nuclear-armed superpower leader who is unusually boastful, obsessed with “winning,” and fond of public threats.
Benjamin L. Corey
+1

He was a political outsider from business whose 2016 victory was a genuine upset and who lost the popular vote.
Brookings

Russian interference in 2016 and disinformation campaigns are well documented, even though their exact effect on the outcome is debated.
SURFACE

He has a string of real-estate branding, especially “Trump Tower,” and used the presidency in ways many ethics bodies called uniquely self-enriching.
Benjamin L. Corey
+1

White evangelicals have been his most reliable base, and some leaders talk about him in quasi-messianic or providential terms.
Pew Research Center
+2
The Guardian
+2

The border policies, COVID handling, Lafayette Square, and the assassination attempt are historical events, not fabrications.
Benjamin L. Corey
+1

So as social and theological critique of Trump and his evangelical support, Corey is pulling on real data.

3.2 Where it gets very speculative

The big move is taking texts that, in context, are about:

Antiochus IV and Hellenistic kings in Daniel

Roman imperial persecution in Revelation

broad categories of deceivers in 1 John

…and re-aiming them very specifically at one US president 2,000+ years later. That’s a huge hermeneutical jump that most scholars do not think is warranted.
Psephizo
+2
Encyclopedia Britannica
+2

Examples of stretch:

Treating “king of the North vs South” as US vs Mexico, when in Daniel it is clearly about rival dynasties around Israel.

Reading every major 2019-2020 event (border wall funding, pandemic, protests, food prices, oil glut, Lafayette Square) as specifically foreseen in those texts rather than using them as flexible symbols of injustice.

Counting a portfolio of seven branded towers as the “seven heads” of the beast - Revelation’s imagery originally points far more neatly to Rome as the city on seven hills.
Encyclopedia Britannica
+1

So at the level of rigorous exegesis, Corey is not doing what biblical studies departments would sign off on. He’s doing creative, highly pointed midrash: using scripture symbolically to reflect on current politics.

3.3 Where mainstream theology lands

Pulling from the more neutral sources:

Many theologians argue “antichrist” is best understood as a recurring archetype - any leader or system that mimics Christ, demands total loyalty, lies, persecutes and exalts itself.
Psephizo
+2
Encyclopedia Britannica
+2

On that view, there have been many plausible “antichrists” (Hitler, Stalin, cult leaders, etc.), and Trump could be an antichrist in that pattern, without being the final one.
Reformed Journal
+1

Others stress John’s insistence that “many antichrists have already come,” pushing Christians away from guessing games about a single villain and toward discernment about any movement that denies Christ by its actions.
Encyclopedia Britannica
+1

So there is space within Christian theology to say “Trump exhibits antichrist-like traits” without buying into a literal “Bible predicted Trump in Daniel 11, Revelation 13” framework.

4. So, how many prophecies “line up” with Trump?

If you list Corey’s checklist (superpower ruler, arrogant, boastful, threatening, outsider shock win, minority vote + foreign meddling, self-enrichment, loyalist rewards, lawless, fake-news deceit, border feud, harming the south, evangelical support, religious ally, pandemic mishandling, protests, desecrating church area, near-fatal head wound, etc.) and compare:

Strong sociological/theological parallels

Arrogant boasting, winner obsession, strongman style

Disregard for norms and legal constraints

Heavy reliance on religious allies to sanctify his rule

Nationalist, punitive stance toward vulnerable outsiders

Interesting but likely coincidental overlaps

Seven branded towers

Exact north/south border fight mapping

Pandemic / food price / oil combo

The timing of border visits and Pentagon money

The specific “head wound” verse vs the assassination attempt

Areas that really do not match literal Revelation-beast expectations

No compulsory “mark” controlling buying and selling

No global worship cult enforced on pain of death

No explicit blasphemous self-deification in a temple setting

No clear 42-month dictatorship over the whole world

So like with your MrBeast question, once you demand detailed, literal fulfillment of Revelation, Trump does not cleanly fit the whole package. But unlike MrBeast, lots of Trump’s rhetoric, behavior and alliances fit the “antichrist type” in a pretty on-the-nose way, which is why you see so many Christian writers calling him “an antichrist” or even the Antichrist in op-eds and sermons.

5. What this is useful for

The way I’d use Corey’s piece:

Not as “aha, prophecy solved, Trump = Antichrist”

But as a sharp mirror showing how easily a religious movement that says it’s always “watching for the Antichrist” can actually cheer for someone whose behavior matches the biblical warnings they quote about other people.
