# Biblical Predictions about the Antichrist

## 1. Military Superpower Nation (Daniel 7:23)
**The Antichrist will be the leader of a nation that is a military superpower with the ability to trample and crush the entire earth.**

The prophecy indicates the Antichrist will come from a nation different from previous empires, powerful enough to "devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces." This suggests a nuclear superpower. Revelation also mentions the Antichrist having power to "call down fire from the sky." This likely narrows it to Russia or the United States, both having thousands of nuclear warheads. Revelation 17:15 further describes the Antichrist coming from a place of "multitudes of peoples, nations, and languages" which suggests a "melting pot" nation like the United States.

## 2. Boastful Speeches (Daniel 7:8, Revelation 13:5)
**The Antichrist will be a man who is exceptionally arrogant and will be known for giving boastful speeches.**

The Bible indicates the Antichrist won't be a quiet, humble leader who flies under the radar, but someone who loves to give speeches where he boasts about himself.

## 3. Public Threats (Revelation 13:2, Daniel 7:4)
**The Antichrist will be someone known for making a lot of public threats against people.**

The prophecy compares the Antichrist to a lion - "had a mouth like that of a lion." This suggests someone who loves to go around "roaring" - making threats to enemies and constantly verbally flexing his power.

## 4. Obsessed with Winning (Revelation 6:2)
**The Antichrist will be someone obsessed with winning.**

The Bible describes the Antichrist as someone "bent on conquering." While most people like to win, this figure will be different - so obsessed with winning that he'll talk about it constantly, perhaps even fantasizing about winning so much that people get tired of it.

## 5. Seven Hills/Towers (Revelation 13:1, Ch. 17)
**The Antichrist will come from among 7 tall "hills" that each act as a "head."**

John described the Antichrist "rising up from the sea" in a vision from the Island of Patmos. The beast had 7 heads, symbolizing 7 "hills" that stood up high. Hills are metaphorical for places of power in the Bible. The prophecy indicates these 7 "heads" would all have someone's name written across them. The article notes that Trump owns exactly seven buildings formally named "Trump Towers" around the world, and they have antenna-like structures on top (which the article compares to the "horns" in John's vision).

## 6. Global Following (Revelation 13:3)
**The Antichrist will cause people all over the globe to be filled with wonder and "follow" him.**

The prophecy states "The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast." The article notes this verse suggests the Antichrist is more likely to appear in the modern world than the ancient one, as 2,000 years ago it would not have been possible for people all over the globe to become fascinated by a political leader, let alone "follow" them. The article implies this could relate to social media following.

## 7. Political Outsider (Daniel 11:21)
**The Antichrist will be a political outsider with despicable character and a contemptuous personality who wins an election that no one expects him to win.**

The prophecy describes "a despicable person will arise... a man of contempt... to whom the royal honor has not been rightfully conferred. He will slip in when least expected and will seize the kingdom through flattery and intrigue." This suggests a candidate who came from the private sector (not of 'royal' background) with questionable morality and a contemptuous personality, who campaigns on flattery and lies but somehow wins an election no one expected him to win, leaving the country stunned.

## 8. Great and Greater Things (Daniel 7:20)
**The Antichrist will give speeches where he speaks "great things" and then about things that are even "greater."**

The Bible specifically predicts that the Antichrist will be known for speaking of "great" and "greater" things, using this specific terminology. This would be part of his boastful speech pattern.

## 9. Collusion and Minority Support (Daniel 11:23)
**The Antichrist comes to power through collusion with a secret alliance who uses disinformation to help him win, even though he has a minority number of supporters.**

"After an alliance is made with him he will practice deception, and he will go up and gain power with a small force of people." This prophecy suggests an election where someone won with fewer supporters, and where an outside power meddled with the process to specifically put that person in office.

## 10. Miraculous Rise to Power (2 Thessalonians 2:9)
**The Antichrist's rise to power will seem like a miracle that God performed, tricking people into following Satan instead of God without even noticing.**

"The arise in power of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie." The prophecy suggests Satan will attempt to make it appear as though God himself was responsible for the Antichrist's rise to power, tricking believers.

## 11. Self-Enrichment Through Power (Daniel 11:24)
**As president, the Antichrist will immediately find ways to make himself and his friends richer– and he will do it in a way no president had ever done before.**

"Then he will distribute among his followers the plunder and wealth of the rich—something his predecessors had never done." The Bible indicates the Antichrist will be unique from all other presidents before him in the way he will use the presidency to instantly get richer and give money to his friends. The prophecy suggests this would likely be fulfilled if a rich business person were to win an election and then serve as president while maintaining a business structure that enriches himself and his friends in unprecedented ways.

## 12. Wanting to Change Times and Laws (Daniel 7:25)
**Once in power the Antichrist will reveal that his heart wants to make alterations to the "appointed times" that are in current laws.**

"He will try to change the set times and the laws." The Bible doesn't say he actually succeeds in changing these appointed cycles, but that he expresses wanting to change them. This could manifest as wanting to change elections, skip/delay an election, or extend term limits.

## 13. Champion of Fake News and Deceit (Daniel 8:25, 2 Thessalonians 2:10)
**The Antichrist will make fake news popular and will be a chronic liar. His followers will believe his delusions because they hate the truth.**

"He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior... He will use every kind of evil deception to fool those on their way to destruction, because they refuse to love and accept the truth that would save them." The prophecy warns to look for someone who calls the truth "fake news" and who is known for constantly lying. The Bible indicates the Antichrist lies so much that it stops calling him the Antichrist and starts calling him "The Liar" - as if he personifies fake news and lies.

## 14. Rewarding Loyalty with Power and Real Estate (Daniel 11:39b)
**The Antichrist will reward those who are completely loyal with powerful positions and lucrative real estate deals.**

"He will greatly honor those who acknowledge him. He will make them rulers over many people and will sell them land at a price." The prophecy specifically mentions real estate deals as one way the Antichrist rewards loyalty.

## 15. Blasphemous Public Speech (Revelation 13:5-6)
**The Antichrist will give an arrogant public speech in the middle of his first term where he boasts of "great things" but also uses God's name as a curse in the same speech.**

"And there was given to him a mouth speaking of 'great things' and blasphemous words... and he opened his mouth saying terrible things and blasphemed the name of God." This prophecy provides a very specific identifying marker - the Antichrist will give a speech where he both brags about his accomplishments using the term "great things" and uses God's name in a blasphemous way in the same speech.

## 16. Christian Support Despite Clear Warning Signs (Matthew 24:24, 2 Thessalonians 2:10)
**The Antichrist will draw strong support from many Christians as if they are willfully blind and outright delusional.**

"For false Christs and false prophets will arise and appear to perform 'great' signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, God's own people. He will use every kind of evil deception to fool those on their way to destruction..." The prophecy suggests that despite clear warning signs, many Christians will support the Antichrist, as if under a strong delusion.

## 17. Considers Himself Above the Law (2 Thessalonians 2)
**The Antichrist will not care about what is legal or constitutional, because the laws of the nation will not apply to him - he will be above the law.**

"The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie..." The Bible repeatedly calls the Antichrist the "lawless one." At its most basic definition, "lawless" means that the law does not apply. This indicates the Antichrist will have no desire or need to obey the laws of his country - somehow he will be immune and will know that he can do anything he wants without consequence.

## 18. Feud with the Southern Border Nation (Daniel 11:40)
**The Antichrist will spend his first term in office having an ongoing feud with the leadership of the nation on his southern border.**

"He will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South..." This prophecy suggests a continuing conflict specifically with a nation to the south of the Antichrist's country.

## 19. Intentional Harm to Southern Ethnic Group (Daniel 11:28, Zechariah 11:16-17)
**The Antichrist will be so angry at the king to his south that he will decide to intentionally inflict harm on that ethnic group in retaliation.**

"He will set himself against the people... doing much damage before continuing his journey." The Bible predicts that after negotiations fail at the southern border, the Antichrist decides to get even by intentionally inflicting harm and distress on that ethnic group. Zechariah's prophecy adds: "There will be a leader over the land who will not help the ones who are dying. He will not go looking for the young who got lost, or care for the children. He won't help the ones who are sick or broken, or even give nourishment to the hungry ones who are still healthy." The article suggests this could relate to treatment of migrants at the southern border.

## 20. Raging at Reports from the East and North (Daniel 11:44)
**The Antichrist will be furious over "rumors and reports" that come from the east and north, and will fly into fits of rage as the reports surface.**

"But reports will trouble him from the east and north, and he will set out in a tremendous rage to destroy and wipe out many." The prophecy indicates that in the middle of his feud along the southern border, the Antichrist will hear troubling "rumors and reports" specifically from the eastern and northern parts of the country. These reports will "frighten" him and leave him so furious that he has fits of rage and will want to destroy people over the reports.

## 21. Surviving a Fatal Wound (Revelation 13:3)
**The Antichrist will appear to receive a "fatal wound to the head" but the whole world will be amazed he survived.**

"And I saw one of his heads that was wounded as if fatal, but it was healed and the world was amazed." The article originally suggested this could be interpreted metaphorically (surviving an impeachment attempt or legal case), but in July 2024, Trump was literally shot in the head during a rally, with the bullet grazing his ear, and he survived - an event that shocked the world. The original article (written in 2019) notes: "If there's ever a leader who fits this description who actually gets shot in the head and lives & comes into even more power after, I'd run for the hills." The prophecy indicates people will be amazed he survived, and that this event will either help him gain followers or cause his existing followers to become more devoted and energized - which appeared to happen after the assassination attempt, with his poll numbers rising and supporters becoming more enthusiastic.

## 22. Religious Leader Support (Revelation 13:11-12)
**The Antichrist will have the nation's most powerful religious leader influencing the country for him. This leader will try to convince Christians that the Antichrist is "God's pick" and that we need to support him.**

"And then I saw a second beast come from the Earth who looked like a lamb but spoke like a dragon... and it deceived the inhabitants of the Earth..." The Bible predicts the Antichrist will survive a near-fatal wound to his rule, but then will need the most powerful religious leader in the country to help him solidify support among religious people to stay in power - specifically around the 3 1/2 year mark (re-election season). The prophecy describes a political/religious alliance where the most influential religious leader in the country speaks to large crowds, displaying religious credentials, to generate support for the Antichrist's rule to continue beyond the initial term.

## 23. Christians Hold Power but Are Not the Good Guys (Daniel 12:7)
**During the worst years of his rule, "Christians" will hold the vast majority of power in the land, but they aren't the good guys.**

"When the power of the Holy People has been finally broken, all these things will be completed." According to the article, the Antichrist will come to power and be successful not despite Christians, but because of Christians. They will be his chief supporters, and according to the prophecy, also the people God is fighting against behind the scenes. In Daniel's vision, he is told that the end-game of God's plan is ensuring the power of the "Holy People" (those who claim to be set apart for God - Christians) is broken.

## 24. Alliance with War Criminal in Israel (Daniel 9:26-27)
**During these times, there will be an evil ruler in Israel who will wage war and cause cities to become desolate.**

"The ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary... war will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed." When the Antichrist is in power, he will have an ally ruling Israel who is a ruthless war criminal and who flattens entire cities, killing thousands of innocent women, children, and others.

## 25. Focus on Coastal Areas in Israel (Daniel 11:16-18)
**The Antichrist will form an alliance with the ruler of Israel and will desire to occupy the coastal area.**

"The invader will do as he pleases; no one will be able to stand against him. He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land, and will have the power to destroy it. He will determine to come with the might of his entire kingdom, and make an alliance... then, he will turn his attention to the coastlands." The prophecy indicates the Antichrist will somehow want to enter or occupy the biblical land of Israel, and his attention will specifically be on the coastal areas - either Gaza in the south or the area of Haifa in the north.

## 26. Global Pandemic (Revelation 8:10)
**During the rule of the Antichrist there will be a global pandemic that will kill many people.**

"...and many people died from the waters that had become bitter." The Bible predicts that during the rule of the Antichrist, there will be a global pandemic where an illness enters the country from a foreign place, spreading in liquid form (cough, sneeze) and ends up killing many people both nationally and globally.

## 27. Neglect of the Vulnerable During Crisis (Zechariah 11:6)
**During the pandemic the Antichrist will not prioritize the vulnerable.**

"There will be a leader over the land who will not help the ones who are dying." According to the article, when the pandemic hits, the Antichrist will delay action even though he knows people will die, publicly spread scientifically false information that could get people killed, and be in far more of a hurry to get back to "winning" than to help the sick and dying.

## 28. Strange Dreams Phenomenon (Acts 2:17)
**During the rule of the Antichrist people will begin having strange and vivid dreams.**

"In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams." The article notes that during the pandemic, there was a significant increase in people reporting strange and vivid dreams across the country, with queries on Google about "why am I having weird dreams lately" quadrupling. This unusual psychological phenomenon was widely reported in major publications.

## 29. Food Shortages and Price Increases with Cheap Oil (Revelation 6:6)
**During the rule of the Antichrist there will be food shortages and huge spike in food prices, but will be a surplus of oil that remains cheap.**

"Two pounds of wheat for a day's wages, and six pounds of barley for a day's wages, and do not damage the oil!" The Bible predicts food shortages causing dramatic price increases while leaving some commodities untouched. The article points to March/April 2020, when many Americans experienced empty grocery store shelves for the first time and food prices had their biggest increase since 1974 - at the same time that oil was in such surplus that it briefly had a negative price.

## 30. Civil Unrest and Resistance (Daniel 11:33)
**During the reign of the Antichrist those who are wise to what is happening will rise up and resist in a period of civil unrest that will get a lot of attention. They will face violence from security forces and receive no help from the Antichrist.**

"Those who are wise will instruct many, though for a time they will fall by the sword or be burned or captured or plundered. When they fall, they will receive a little help, and many who are not sincere will join them." The prophecy predicts a period of civil unrest where those who "resist" speak out against the culture of the Antichrist. Protesters will face violence from security forces, some will "fall" and get no help, and their movement will be co-opted by opportunists whose motive is to plunder (loot) but who are not sincere members of the resistance.

## 31. Church Photo Op After Clearing Protesters (Daniel 11:29-33)
**The Antichrist will use his armed forces to remove people from the area surrounding a church and will do something detestable in front of it.**

"His armed forces will rise up to desecrate the area surrounding the temple, so that they can set up the abomination that leaves the area empty." The prophecy indicates the Antichrist will use the military to clear out the area outside a church until it is empty and desolate. Then he will do something outside the church that is an abomination to God. The article references the June 1, 2020 incident where federal officers used teargas and rubber bullets on peaceful protesters in Washington D.C. to clear the area so Trump could walk to a local church for a staged photo op with a Bible. The article notes he had clergy thrown off church property to do this, and the pastor was "absolutely furious."

## 32. Violent Rebellion by Supporters (Daniel 11:14, 1 Timothy 3:2)
**Supporters of the Antichrist will grow to hate those "from the south", will become violent, and will ultimately stage a rebellion in support of Antichrist - but will fail.**

"Those who are violent among your own people will rebel in fulfillment of the vision, but without success." The prophecy describes the Antichrist's followers (specifically identified as "Christians" in the article) getting fully on board with his hatred of those to the south. At some point during his rule, they will stage a violent rebellion that is unsuccessful. The article also references 1 Timothy 3:2, noting that his supporters will eventually reach a point where they see "nothing as sacred anymore."

## 33. Putting His Name Above God (Daniel 11:36)
**The Antichrist will do something to 'put his name above God', and will be known for saying outlandish things.**

"He will exalt and magnify himself above every god, and will say unheard of things." According to the article, the Antichrist would be so arrogant and full of self-pride that he would do something as outlandish as coming out with a new version of the Bible that puts his own name at the very top.

## 34. Mass Disappearance of Agricultural Workers (Matthew 24:40-41)
**During the rule of Antichrist, there will be a mass disappearance of agricultural workers.**

"Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left." The article interprets this prophecy as describing how the Antichrist will rip apart families, with untold numbers of people quickly disappearing - specifically individuals working in fields or producing/harvesting needed products for society. This would cause disruptions in important industries and result in the destruction of countless family units.

## 35. Self-Exaltation as King of Israel (2 Thessalonians 2:4, Revelation 17)
**The Antichrist will see himself as being above everyone else, as if he had no need for God. He will eventually elevate himself as the God and King of Israel.**

"And he will exalt himself above all... so that he sets himself up in God's own temple in Israel, proclaiming himself to be God." The prophecy indicates the Antichrist will see himself as flawless and have zero reverence for God, claiming he's "never seen a need to ask God forgiveness." The article points to a specific example where Trump literally described himself as "the King of Israel" and being like "the second coming of God."

## 36. Followers Wearing a Mark on Their Foreheads (Revelation 13)
**The Antichrist's most devoted followers will wear a sign of their allegiance to him on their foreheads.**

"And they received a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads..." The article suggests this could refer to the red MAGA hats worn by Trump supporters, rather than the barcodes or chips that many had traditionally expected this prophecy to entail.

## 37. Resistance Movement Against Him (Daniel 11:32)
**The people who truly know God and remain faithful will firmly "resist" him.**

"With flattery he will corrupt those who have violated the covenant, but the people who know their God will firmly resist him." The prophecy indicates that while many will be corrupted by the Antichrist's flattery, those who truly know God will recognize him for what he is and will actively resist him. The article points out that even the name of the movement against Trump - "Resist" - is mentioned in the Antichrist narrative.
